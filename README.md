# Admin Dashboard

## TOP instructions

Now that you’ve had plenty of practice using Grid, we are going to build a full dashboard design. For this project, use whatever tools you need to get it done, but try to lean on Grid for the majority of the layout work. Go back through the lessons or practice assignments if you need a refresher.

Download a full-resolution copy of the [project design file](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) and get a general idea for how you’re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.

This project does not have to be responsive, but if you’d like to you can expand or shrink the project cards section when resizing the browser window.

You don’t have to make a pixel perfect match with the design example. Consider this an opportunity to practice your CSS skills with your own designs.
